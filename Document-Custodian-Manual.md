## Table of Contents

## Course Objectives
- To provide an understanding of the proper interpretation of the reqwuirements for a Documented INforation Control System suitable to your QMS
- To provide guidance on how to maintain proper file control to keep track of files

## 7.5 Documented information

### 7.5.3 Control of documented information
- 7.5.3.1 Documented information required by the quality management system and by this International Standard shall be controlled to ensure:
- a) it is available and suitable for use, where and when it is needed;
- b) it is adequately protected (e.g. from loss of confidentiality, improper use, or loss of integrity).

## The Plan-Do-Check-Act Cycle

## Intent of ISO Management Systems
ISO Requires a "Documented Management System" and not a "System of Documents"

## Definition of a Document
**Information and its supporting medium**

Information = Meaningful data

Documents may be in any form or type of medium, and the definition of "document" in ISO 9000 clause 3.7.2 gives the following examples:

- Paper
- Magnetic
- Electronic or optical computer disc
- Photograph
- Video
- Master Sample

## Objectives of Documentation

### Communication of intent and information
- Citizen to organization
- Organization to citizen
- Top management to organization
- Organization to Top Management
- Organization with itself

### Knowledge sharing
- In order to disseminate and preserve the organization's experiences
- Compilation of best practices
- Provision of effective training materials

### To show evidence of conformity
- Provision of evidence that what was planned, has actually been done

## Extent of Documentation
- The type and extent of the documentation will depend on:
  - The size of the organization and type of activities;
  - The complexity of processes, and;
  - The competence of personnel
- Analysis of the processes should be the driving force for defining the amount of documentation needed for the quality management system

## Who documents the processes?
- **Process Owners** must be responsible for writing their respective procedures
- **Heads of departments** must have approval of all procedures under their areas of responsibility

## Control of Documents

### Requirements
- Approval prior to use
- Review, updatew as necessary and re-approve documents
- Changes and the current revision status are identified
- Relevant versions of applicable documents are available at points of use
- Documents remain legible and readily identifiable
- Documents of external origin are determined by the organization are identified and their distribution controlled
- Suitable identification of obsolete documents to prevent unintended use

## The Document Controller
The Document Controller is the on in charge of the management of documents of a certain project, department, or organization.

### Typical Tasks
- Manages documents (internal and external)
- Checks quality and compliance of documents
- Maintains a list or register of documents
- Files documents
- Distributes documents to relevant people
- Reports on the progress of the documents

## Effective Infrastructure of Documentation

### Hard Copy System
- The master (original) electronic documents are stored as electronic files (ex. Word)
- Master lists are stored as spreadsheet files (ex. Excel)
- Files are managed by a document controller
- Documents printed from these files are stamped "CONTROLLED"
- When printed, these are distributed to the different areas of the organization
- The Masterlist includes all the documents and forms (internal and external) used by the organization
- A "Document Feedback Form" is used to introduce or initiate revisions to any document

### Electronic System

#### Requirements
- Establish a database for all processes, procedures, work instructions, and forms
- The database is controlled by a system administrator and must be backed-up periodically
- Access authority defined by levels, rights usernames, and passwords
- Use of corporate email
- An "author" writes / revises a document that is sent electronically for review and approval
- Upon approval, document is uploaded into the database for access
- Affected functions are notified through email
- Printing of documents has restrictions: **Printouts have expiry dates**
- Users of procedures or other documents have electronic access (read only)

## Document VS. Record

### Definition of Document
- Information and its supporting medium.

***Note:** The medium can be paper, magnetic, electronic or optical computer disc, photograph or master sample or a combination thereof (ISO 9000:2015, 3.7.2)*

### Definition of Records
- Document stating results achieved or providing evidence of activities performed. *(ISO 9000:2005, 3.7.6)*

| **Document**                                                                 | **Record**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Prescriptive:**<br> - Specifies what, when, who, where, how <br> - Defines requirements | **Descriptive:**<br> - Details what has been done <br> - Confirms conformance to QMS <br> - Provides evidence of requirement fulfillment |

## Contorl of Records

### Requirements
- Controlled as evidence of conformance to requirements and of effective operation of QMS
- Records must remain legible, readily identifiable, and retrievable
- There should be defined controls needed for the identification, storage, retrieval, protection, retention, and disposition of quality records

***Note:** Records Management in government should be consistent with the guidelines of the National Archives of the Philippines (NAP)*

- Ensure all required data in forms used are completely filled-out
- Only marking pens are used on records. Pencil markings are avoided and may be considered unofficial.
- Some records require the signature of authorized individuals. The reviewer ensures that said records are legible and contain sufficient information as basis for its endorsement or approval. Hence, some records without the signature of approving authorities may be treated "unofficial."
- In case of erasures or corrections, the wrong data is crossed out and countersigned by the person who corrected it.

## Why do we need to maintain records?

### Organizations must create and maintain records:
- To ensure that functions and activities are adequately and properly documented
- To provide evidence of conformity to standards of their processes

***Note:** The recordkeeping requirements necessary to ensure adequate and proper documentation will vary.*

## How are recordkeeping requireents determined?

### Organizations must create and maintain records:
- The nature of the company and its mission
- Specific statutory or regualtory requirements that directly affect the recordsand their retention
- The information in the records
- Conformity of processes to certaion standards

## How lond do we need to retain records?
- The retention period depends on the records' legal, administrative, or historical value.
- The appropriate retention period is determined in the appraisal process that takes place during the development and approval of the **Records Disposition Schedule**

## RA 9470: The National Archives of the Philippines Act of 2007

### Article 1, Paragraph 3 of the Implementing RUles and Regulations of RA 9470
